# Tailwind CSS Tech Sample <br/><small>_by_ ‹div›RIOTS</small>

This is a _Technology Sample_ you can rely on to build your own Design System, based on React and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

**Disclaimer**: _Technology Samples_ aren't comprehensive _Design Systems_ but showcases a given technology so you free to build you own solution upon it.

## Architecture

This _tech sample_ declares its **Design Tokens** using the [Tailwind CSS Theme Config](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) syntax. Each component in your Design System can exploit those theme specific tokens using the atomic classes exposed by Tailwind CSS.

To build its components, this _tech sample_ uses [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) and [React/JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Components are then styled using Tailwind CSS atomic classes, according to Headless UI examples.

_Note_: The use of Headless UI is **not** mandatory and you can use any kind of framework allowing you to customize the rendering process with CSS classes. Headless UI is built by [Tailwind Labs](https://github.com/tailwindlabs) whom also provide _Tailwind CSS_.

### Tokens

The Tokens are split in different components:

- `typography`: fonts families
- `colors`: colors, variants, and helpers
- `borders`: borders and radius
- `opacity`: transparency values
- `shadows`: shadows effects
- `spacing`: relative and absolute spaces
- `z-index`: z-axe indexes

### Tailwind CSS Theme

All tokens are declared in the [Tailwind CSS Theme Config](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) syntax by exporting them in dedicated objects, e.g.:

```ts
export const typography = {
  fontFamily: {
    code: ['Consolas', 'SFMono-Regular', 'Monaco', 'monospace'],
  },
  fontWeight: {
    custom: '600',
  },
};
```

Then all tokens definitions are merged in the `~/theme/` component to build the global Tailwind CSS `theme.extend` definition. This `theme` is used in the `tailwind.config.js` file directly to setup all the classes and variants.

## Components

Components can exploit the Tailwind CSS atomic classes directly:

```jsx
<button
  className={`
    ${active ? 'bg-purple-500 text-white' : 'text-grey-900'}
    flex items-center w-full px-2 py-2
    group rounded-md
    text-sm
  `}
>
  Click Me!
</button>
}
```

## Stories

Stories are written in Storybook's [Component Story Format](https://backlight.dev/docs/component-story-format). Components' stories are located in their `stories/` folder.

## Documentation

Documentation pages are decorated by a React layout using the [@divriots/dockit-react](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-react) helpers. See the `mdx-layout` component.

### Pages

Each component embed its own documentation in its `doc/` folder. You can use any web format for your documentation but we recommend you to write it with the [mdx](https://backlight.dev/docs/mdx) format, allowing you to embed your components live in the documentation.
